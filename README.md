This project develops a Java-based simulator for the WWII Enigma encryption machine, capable of encoding and decoding messages with user-defined settings. 
It includes a comprehensive set of classes such as Main, Machine, Rotor types, Reflector, Permutation, and EnigmaException, along with test classes like MovingRotorTest and PermutationTest. 
The simulator effectively replicates the Enigma machine's complexities using object-oriented programming, ensuring modularity, extensibility, and efficiency. 
It aims to authentically mirror the Enigma's encryption and decryption processes while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.
